**CopyOwn** | **bool** | If checked, users can copy any of their own packages that they have uploaded, assuming that they still have write privilege for the repository.

Otherwise, help will only be shown for packages that are in the repository. For example, if you have uploaded only NuGet packages, then the Set Me Up help for NuGet packages will be shown only. | [optional] [default to null]
**Size** | **int32** | The calculated size of the repository. | [optional] [default to null]

**StrictNpmValidation** | **bool** | If checked, npm packages will be validated strictly to ensure the package matches specifcation. You can turn this off if you have packages that are old or otherwise mildly off-spec, but we can&#39;t guarantee the packages will work with npm-cli or other tooling correctly. Turn off at your own risk! | [optional] [default to null]
**UseDebianLabels** | **bool** | If checked, a &#39;Label&#39; field will be present in Debian-based repositories. It will contain a string that identifies the entitlement token used to authenticate the repository, in the form of &#39;source&#x3D;t-&lt;identifier&gt;&#39;; or &#39;source&#x3D;none&#39; if no token was used. You can use this to help with pinning. | [optional] [default to null]
**UseDefaultCargoUpstream** | **bool** | If checked, dependencies of uploaded Cargo crates which do not set an explicit value for \&quot;registry\&quot; will be assumed to be available from crates.io. If unchecked, dependencies with unspecified \&quot;registry\&quot; values will be assumed to be available in the registry being uploaded to. Uncheck this if you want to ensure that dependencies are only ever installed from Cloudsmith unless explicitly specified as belong to another registry. | [optional] [default to null]
**UseNoarchPackages** | **bool** | If checked, noarch packages (if supported) are enabled in installations/configurations. A noarch package is one that is not tied to specific system architecture (like i686). | [optional] [default to null]
