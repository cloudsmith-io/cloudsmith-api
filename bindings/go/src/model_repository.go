	ContextualAuthRealm bool `json:"contextual_auth_realm,omitempty"`
	// If checked, users can copy any of their own packages that they have uploaded, assuming that they still have write privilege for the repository. This takes precedence over privileges configured in the 'Access Controls' section of the repository, and any inherited from the org.
	CopyOwn bool `json:"copy_own,omitempty"`
	// This defines the minimum level of privilege required for a user to copy packages. Unless the package was uploaded by that user, in which the permission may be overridden by the user-specific copy setting.

	StorageRegion string `json:"storage_region,omitempty"`
	// If checked, npm packages will be validated strictly to ensure the package matches specifcation. You can turn this off if you have packages that are old or otherwise mildly off-spec, but we can't guarantee the packages will work with npm-cli or other tooling correctly. Turn off at your own risk!
	StrictNpmValidation bool `json:"strict_npm_validation,omitempty"`
	// If checked, a 'Label' field will be present in Debian-based repositories. It will contain a string that identifies the entitlement token used to authenticate the repository, in the form of 'source=t-<identifier>'; or 'source=none' if no token was used. You can use this to help with pinning.
	UseDebianLabels bool `json:"use_debian_labels,omitempty"`
	// If checked, dependencies of uploaded Cargo crates which do not set an explicit value for \"registry\" will be assumed to be available from crates.io. If unchecked, dependencies with unspecified \"registry\" values will be assumed to be available in the registry being uploaded to.

	UseDefaultCargoUpstream bool `json:"use_default_cargo_upstream,omitempty"`
